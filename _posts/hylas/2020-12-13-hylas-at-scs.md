These are some notes to accompany my online presentation at the Society for Classical Studies convention, January 2021.

If there’s a link to the actual presentation somewhere, I’ll post that. For now, you can read over the PowerPoint, which I’ve included [here](/assets/SCS_2021.pdf) in PDF format.

Articles and books to which I refer in the presentation are:

- A. W. Bulloch, “A Callimachean Refinement to the Greek Hexameter,” _Classical Quarterly_ 20 (1970): 258–268.
- D. S. Raven, _Latin Metre_ (London, 1965).
- Richard F. Thomas, “Vergil’s _Georgics_ and the Art of Reference,” _Harvard Studies in Classical Philology_ 90 (1986): 171–198. [https://doi.org/10.2307/311468](https://doi.org/10.2307/311468)

Among the issues I grapple with in the presentation is what “counts” as a word-break in Greek (or, for that matter, Latin, where the question is even less developed). The problem has been pointed out before:

> A. M. Devine and Laurence Stephens, “The Greek Appositives: Toward a Linguistically Adequate Definition of Caesura and Bridge,” _Classical Philology_ 73(4) (1978): 314–328. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/268852>
